FIXME:  when creating a new convo, if we get an error, we cant create a new convo even with correct details.
        have to reload in order for it to work again.
REASON: UNKNOWN
IDEAS:  NONE

FIXME:  can create two convos with the same person.
REASON: "hasConvoFlag" not updating for some reason.
IDEAS:  make sure we are not able to do that on the server side.

TODO: work on the server tomorrow
